Basic Arithmetic: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division

Scientific Functions: trigonometric (sin, cos, tan), logarithmic, power, square root

Matrix Operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, determinant

Quadratic Equation Solver

Unit Conversions

Calculation History: automatically saved to a file with timestamps



Compile the program

gcc advanced_calculator.c -o calculator



Collaboration

Created by Awkash Rathore in collaboration with Mrs. Kasak.


Notes
